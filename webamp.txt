Webamp is a port of Winamp 2 (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp#Winamp_2) for use on the web. Upload files or folders and watch the magic happen. MP3, OGG, FLAC, whatever.
Are you a dumbass who only listens to sped up and slowed music on Spotify and you still don't understand what this is?
Download music do play thing
/music on whatever link you're on
Good tools for actually getting music are SquidWTF (squid.wtf) and Lucida (lucida.to). We don't actually provide any files, this is just a player.
Also you can get skins here: 
skins.webamp.org
winampheritage.com/skins
